Mainline x-loader (git://gitorious.org/x-loader/x-loader.git)
  The non-mainline U-Boot mentioned by Robert Berger above
     (git://github.com/koenkooi/u-boot.git)

However, using mainline x-loader and mainline U-Boot, networking does not work from
U-Boot.  Even after "dcache off".

Jason mentioned earlier in the thread that "if it doesn't work then there was
a regression."  There may have been a regression in mainline, then.  What is in
mainline U-Boot does not handle networking properly from U-Boot on Beagle XM,
and what is in the koenkooi tree above does work.
